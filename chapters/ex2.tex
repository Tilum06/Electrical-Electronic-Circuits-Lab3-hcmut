\section{DC Sweep Simulation}
The schematic in the first exersice with \textbf{R1 = 1k} is re-used in this exercise. However, a DC-Sweep simulation mode is performed with V1 is varied from 0V to 5V (0.1V for the step), as follows:

\end{figure}

Run the simulation and trace for the current $I_C$ according to the value of V1. Capture your screen and plot it in the report. Please increase the width of the curve.

\textbf{Your image goes here:}

\end{figure}


When the transistor becomes saturated, the value of V1 is about to 1.95V.

At this value, the value of $I_B$ is about to 1.06mA

And the value of $I_{C(sat)}$ is about to 98mA
